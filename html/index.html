    <h1>Mystery Flesh Pit National Park</h1>
    <p>
      The Mystery Flesh Pit National Park is an online world building project
      created in 2019 on Reddit by an artist named Trevor Roberts. The project
      revolves around the fictional “Mystery Flesh Pit”, a national park located
      near the town of Gumption, Texas. The park itself is a massive
      subterranean organism of unfathomable size discovered during the mid
      1970s, and was made a national park later on in the 1980s before its
      sudden closure to the public in 2007.
